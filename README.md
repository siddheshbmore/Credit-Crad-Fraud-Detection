# Credit-Crad-Fraud-Detection
The problem of credit card fraud detection is an example of a binary classification problem that can be solved using classification algorithms like Random Forests, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbour, etc. You can analyze the performance of these algorithms using metrics like Recall, Precision, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, etc., and deduce which works best for your dataset.
Another way of solving this problem is to treat this as an anomaly detection problem wherein the frauds are treated as anomalies. Then algorithms like Autoencoders, Isolation forest can be used to find out these anomalies.
Machine learning algorithms do not assume the logic that differentiates fraudulent transactions from non-fraudulent ones. Rather, they leverage the transactions details and customersâ€™ information to deduce the characteristics of fraudulent transactions. These algorithms are best suited to reveal the hidden patterns in the dataset and are therefore becoming a popular choice for solving problems like detecting credit card frauds.
